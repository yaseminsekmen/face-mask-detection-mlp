# Face Mask Detection with DenseNet121 & MLP ðŸ˜·

This project is a deep learning model that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not using **DenseNet121** as a feature extractor and **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) as the classifier**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features:
âœ” **Pre-trained DenseNet121** as a backbone  
âœ” **MLP with Fully Connected Layers** for classification  
âœ” **Data Augmentation** to improve robustness  
âœ” **Early Stopping & ReduceLROnPlateau** for better convergence  
âœ” **Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC Score, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**  
âœ” **Achieved over 98% accuracy on test data!**
